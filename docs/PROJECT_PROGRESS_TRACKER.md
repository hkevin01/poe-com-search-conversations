## Part 4: Progress Dashboard

- **Overall Completion:** ~60%  
- **By Phase:**  
  - Phase 1: 100%  
  - Phase 2: 100%  
  - Phase 3: 60% (analytics, search, tagging done; LLM/auto-categorization not started)  
  - Phase 4: 50% (GUI core done, advanced org in progress)  
  - Phase 5: 0% (planned Q1 2025)  
  - Phase 6: 0% (planned Q2 2025)  
- **Ahead of Schedule:** None  
- **Behind Schedule:** LLM features, advanced GUI, hybrid linking  
- **Blocked:** LLM integration, advanced metadata (awaiting resources)  
- **Upcoming (next 2 weeks):**  
  - T4-06: Category/subcategory management (GUI)  
  - T4-07: Visual relationship mapping (GUI)  
  - T3-06: LLM-powered categorization (if resources free up)

---

## Part 5: Gap Analysis

- **Scope Additions:**  
  - Enhanced statistics and progress tracking (not in original plan)
  - More robust error handling and test coverage
- **Cancelled/Deprioritized:**  
  - None formally cancelled, but LLM/AI features deferred for stability
- **Missing Dependencies:**  
  - LLM integration requires local model support and more compute
  - Some GUI features depend on advanced backend APIs not yet built
- **Resource Allocation:**  
  - More effort spent on extraction robustness and test automation than planned
  - AI/LLM and advanced GUI features under-resourced

---

## Part 6: Recommendations

- **Priority Focus:**  
  - Finish GUI category/subcategory management and relationship mapping (T4-06, T4-07)
  - Unblock LLM-powered categorization (T3-06) by allocating AI/dev resources
- **Blocked Items:**  
  - LLM/AI features: Need local model integration and compute resources
  - Advanced metadata: Awaiting backend API and data model updates
- **Plan Adjustments:**  
  - Consider splitting LLM/AI features into a separate milestone for 2025
  - Revisit GUI/UX priorities to deliver incremental value
- **Resource Suggestions:**  
  - Allocate at least 1 FTE to LLM/AI integration for Q3-Q4 2025
  - Increase UI/UX resources for advanced organization features
