## [2025-07-29] Project Plan Continuation

### Major Actions Completed
- All shell scripts moved from root to appropriate subfolders (`scripts/setup/`, `scripts/maintenance/`, `scripts/testing/`).
- All Python utility scripts moved from root to proper locations (maintenance, testing, setup, src).
- `main.py` updated to reference new script locations for all commands.
- Cleanup scripts updated to handle both shell and Python files.
- `tasks.md` and `scripts/README.md` updated to reflect new organization.
- Root directory now contains only essential files and folders.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Review and update all documentation to reflect new script locations and usage.
- [ ] Test all CLI commands (`main.py`) to ensure correct script execution after reorganization.
- [ ] Continue Phase 4 GUI development: settings management, import/export, onboarding wizard.
- [ ] Begin Phase 5: performance optimization, plugin system, advanced export, documentation.
- [ ] Expand test coverage for new and refactored scripts.
- [ ] Monitor for any path/import issues as a result of the reorganization.
